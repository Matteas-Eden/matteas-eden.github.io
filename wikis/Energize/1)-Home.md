# Welcome to Anzen! 安全のサイトへようこそ！


## About the site
Anzen is a webapp designed for messaging and interacting with other users on a hybrid peer-to-peer network that supports the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox. Anzen runs on a CherryPy server written in Python3, with a database backend supported using SQLite for Python. The front end uses Jinja for templating the HTML and Ajax for managing the background tasks in Javascript. 

"Anzen" is the Japanese word for security, chosen due to the project's major focus on privacy, consent, and security. When using the site, a user can be ensured that all of their messages are encrypted and that incoming messages have not been tampered with. 

The UI is designed to be both eye-catching and minimalistic, with visual hints to guide the user on how to interact with the webapp so that the use of the site feels as natural and as comfortable as possible.

## About the developer
Anzen was developed by Matt Eden for COMPSYS302 at the University of Auckland in Semester 1 of 2019. The developer had no to little prior experience in using CSS to design websites, but however has had much experience in general UX and UI design due to previous projects. While having some knowledge of encryption, he had not been required to implement it on this scale before. He had not created servers before and although he had been educated on network concepts in the past, the developer had not taken the chance to implement this knowledge until now.<br>
Matt has spent lots of time working in Python, but had zero experience with Python webservers, so this was an interesting challenge for him. He had used Javascript in a light hobbyist context in the past, but had never needed to implement it in such a way to provide a seamless user experience. While he had learnt about database concepts before, Matt had not used any SQL libraries to manage databases.
