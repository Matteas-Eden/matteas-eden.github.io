                Hi, I'm Matteas Eden. Welcome to my website.
                <br />
                <br />
                At the moment, I'm working through my fourth and final year of a
                Computer Engineering (Honours) degree at the University of
                Auckland in New Zealand.
                <br />
                But of course, I'm also pursuing graduate work opportunities as
                I look to begin my career in Software Development.
                <br />I have always been passionate in all that I do, whether
                it's my accademic studies, my extracurricular commitments or my
                work in industry - I always strive to give 110%.
                <br />
                If you'd like to learn more about me, take a look around the
                website and at the links below.
