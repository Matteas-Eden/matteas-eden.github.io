My personal website. Designed by me, implemented by me and about me - for everyone to see.

### Development

I decided to learn React; so I made a website. There was a lot of blood, sweat and error logs, but in the end it all came together to be what you see today. Combining Material UI and Sass, I was able to create a fluid, scalable and responsive website that looks great on every device.

### Deployment

For automating the deployment of the website to GitHub pages, I created a workflow with GitHub actions that utilises *[Deploy To GitHub Pages](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-github-pages)*. Anytime there's an update to the `development` branch, the changes are reflected in the build on `master` and deployed instantly.

### Design

There are a lot of website designs out there, but I wanted mine to feel unique - so I designed it from scratch, in Paint.NET. I felt it important to ensure that my website scaled with window size, so that it didn't matter whether it was being viewed in 720p or 4k - it would always look exactly the way I wanted it to.
