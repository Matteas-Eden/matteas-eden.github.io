# Issues During Development

While there were many small issues faced during the development cycle of *Energize*, there were none in particular that so massive and overwhelming that they could not be solved with a simple Google search, a couple of tutorials and a little bit of careful thought.

Upon reflection, the main issue that could be considered ever-present throughout the life of *Energize* was the large scope of the game. A demanding list of features was decided upon very early in development, however as time went on and deadlines loomed it became apparent that these self-imposed demands could not be met. As such, some initially planned features are regrettably not present in the final release of *Energize*. It was the decision to abandon some features that allowed us, as a team, to overcome the challenge we placed before ourselves and still deliver a raft of exceptional features in a brilliant package.

# Suitability Analysis

Given the wide availability of free 2D game engines, it was not a wise decision to program *Energize* in Java. It simply would have been more efficient with a software package such as GameMaker studio, Unity or Construct 2. Not only that, but with regard to Unity especially there are a much wider range of tutorials available online for creating 2D games than there is present for Java. This is due to Unity's popularity with game developers the world over, which is also yet another reason that Unity is a better choice for this project than Java, even with the additional usability of JavaFX.

On the other hand, it is worth noting that since Java is a pure Object Oriented Programming language, it does seem fit to use it as a basis for game development. This is because games can easily be reduced into distinct parts, which then interact with each other in unique and interesting ways to produce an enjoyable outcome. From such a description it is clear to see how Object Oriented design fits the bill, however it should also be noted that other OOP languages could have been used in place of Java. A notable example is C#, which is what Unity primarily supports.
