# Game Features

The requirements of the project were that a player could move (and collide) within a level, move between rooms, collect items and defeat enemies, all whilst obtaining a score at the end after an encounter with a boss. In *Energize*, the player can do all of this and more.

## Extra Features
### Adjustable Difficulty
As everyone is different in some way or another, its important to account for this in deciding on the difficulty of a game. To account for a variety of skills and abilities of prospective players, the user can choose between 3 levels of difficulty. "Easy" for those who struggle, "Hard" for those who want a challenge and "Normal" for anyone else who does not fall into either of these categories or who has not played the game before.

### Inventory & Items
There are a total of 5 unique items that the player can pick up and use during their playthrough of the game, with each one being managed by the inventory system. While the player can only equip one item at a time, they can hold an unlimited number of items in their inventory. These items have powerful effects that aid the player, such as restoring health or freezing enemies.

### Randomly Generated Levels
The layout of the map and the layout of each room (with the exception of the starting room and the boss room) are randomly generated. This obviously increases the replay value of *Energize*, as it means that no 2 playthroughs are the same since items and enemies will always be varied.

### Save & Load Maps
If a player starts a new game and they find that they particularly like the map that gets generated, then they can open up a pause menu and save it to replay later, or show to their friends.

### Minimap
In order to assist the player in navigating the - at times - quite large map and also to guide them towards the boss room, a minimap displaying current position, visited rooms and non-visited rooms can be found on the HUD.

### LAN Multiplayer
If the player is finding the game too difficult, instead of simply lowering the difficulty they can ask their friends for help. If multiple individuals with a copy of the game are connected to the same network, any one of those individuals can host a game that the others can join.

### Sound & Music
In order to enhance the enjoyment of players, appropriate background music has been added along with a host of sound effects that accompany various player actions. These include but are not limited to: sword slashes, item pickup sounds and fiery explosions.
