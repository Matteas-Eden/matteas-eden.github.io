# Roadmap

There are a lot of features that I would like to implement on my website. Some are more important than others, but eventually I'd
like to implement all of them.

### MVP
- Pages
  - About
  - Projects
  - Resumé
  - Contact
- Links in the footer of each page
- Proper scaling of components
- Mobile layout

### Future Work
- Background that changes depending on time of day
- Animations between each page (sliding)
- Language switch that provides support for Japanese
