## Personal Portfolio Page

A simple static webpage that holds some basic information about me, as well as showcasing some of my projects and providing links to my various profiles.

**TODO**
- Make the site look better
- Add more projects
- Flesh out the profile description
- Find a better profile picture

You can see a full step by step tutorial of how I got this site [on Medium](https://medium.com/@evanca/set-up-your-portfolio-website-in-less-than-10-minutes-with-github-pages-d0efa8ff56fd).
