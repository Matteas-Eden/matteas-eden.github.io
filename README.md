> Work In Progress

My personal website. Made by me, about me, for me - but free for all to see.

### Development

I decided to learn React; so I made a website. There was a lot of blood, sweat and error logs, but in the end it all came together to be what you see today. Combining Material UI and Sass, I was able to create a fluid, scalable and responsive website that looks great on every device.

### Deployment

###### TBC

### Design

There are a lot of website designs out there, but I wanted mine to feel unique - so I designed it from scratch, in Paint.NET.
