Energize (*Nocturnal Tutelage Studios*, 2019) is a clone of Legend of Zelda (*Nintendo*, 1986) created in Java using the JavaFX graphics library. Energize was made for COMPSYS 302 "Design: Software Practice" at the University of Auckland, New Zealand (not to be confused with Auckland, California).

*Energize* was created to fulfill the needs of a client who wanted their 12-year-old daughter to experience the same joy from video games that they themselves experienced when they were young. As such, *Energize* aims to deliver a enjoyable but accessible experience that is reminiscent of the arcade games of yesteryear. 

### Story
The player follows the journey of Otto, as they embark on a noble quest to save their home, the majestic city of Emberrath, by recovering the central power battery, a magical gem dubbed the Crystalshot. Otto's journey leads them to an eerie laboratory, swarming with other-worldy creatures brought to this plane by none other than Toaseth, he who stole the Crystalshot for nefarious purposes that are left unknown. By defeating Toaseth and recovering the Crystalshot, Otto will restore power and peace to the city, thus becoming a hero known to all.
